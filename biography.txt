John Toomey (but I go by Jack)
I am interested in Data Science because it is very powerful disciple that can has diverse applications in countless fields. I am also interested because of its traceable and verifiable nature - analytically it has the potential to be less subjective than former applied techniques. I also feel it has the power to provide robust solutions to complex questions that would be cumbersome and time consuming (in some cases seemingly impossible) to derive answers.
I have taken introductory coursework in C# and python. In my current position I implement and leverage Geographic Information Systems for Utility and Facility Operations at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I primarily write scripts in python but occasionally and on previous assignments I compile "small" .net (no more than 2000 lines) code in C#/vb and have create some basic widgets for web apps in javascript as well.
I am definitely a little weak when it comes to statistics. I have taken a statistics course (stat 251) in my  undergrad at NMSU but don't have any fond memories of it. I use what I would consider basic statistics at my job including averages, percentages, etc. with the only exception being standard deviations for ensuring GPS accuracies and for utility asset condition assessments.
I have no previous experience with R but I think python may be my favorite language and usually take an interest in how anyone is using python anytime it is mentioned.
Improving some web scraping techniques with Python and hopefully some awesome data crunching techniques in R and maybe learn about some of the applications of R in "spatial" analytics.
Not at this time no.
